Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach in agentic AI development, enabling AI systems to combine reasoning with dynamic knowledge access. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG allows an agent to query external sources—such as databases, APIs, or document stores—in real time, enriching its responses with up-to-date and context-specific information. This enhances accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and supports explainability. In agentic AI, where autonomy and decision-making are essential, RAG equips agents to ground actions in verified knowledge, adapt to evolving contexts, and provide users with more reliable, actionable outputs across diverse applications like research, commerce, and productivity.
